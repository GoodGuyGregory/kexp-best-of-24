The latter\\'s lead single, \"Leave Them All Behind\", was the band\\'s most commercially successful song, reaching No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart. Both Going Blank Again and its 1994 follow-up, Carnival of Light, peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart.\\nRide broke up in 1996 prior to the release of their fourth album Tarantula, which received negative reviews.
