## Best of KEXP

for the year of 2024, I have been busier than I have been in the past two years. Overwhelmed, I have decided to relax this year when KEXP released their ever popular **Best of** releases. It's common for a voting system to be deployed and gosh darn it, it often feels like a ticking time bomb. I want to be more than an advid sidliner, I want to be an informed voter... I mean look at this [list](https://www.kexp.org/countdowns/best-of-2024/) its friggin MASSIVE. So for 2024 Enter the Best of KEXP Chatbot ðŸ“» ðŸ¤– . Allowing an LLM to do the heavy lifting and experimenting with it's ability to recommend music to me based on this year's releases, seems fairly relaxing, and takes the stress of playlist queueing out of my hands and directly into my brain holes. ðŸ§  ðŸ¥¹.
